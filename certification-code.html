  <h2>Certification and Accreditation Process</h2>
  <h3>This page will describe some basics about the Certification and Accreditation (C&A) Process. </h3>

<h4 id="certification">Certification</h4>
  
  <p>Certification is the process of ensuring that a omputer system will perform as it is required to perform.  In the cas of security , cerfification will ensure that the security features will operate as advertised or required.  Certification requires that all documentation is reviewed to ensred it is current.  It also requires that every security feature is evalauated to ensure that it functions properly.  Certification ensures that the current security posture will be maintained with the inroduction of new systems into an existing archotecture and that that architecture will not be compromised.  This process can contain formalized methods for evaluating features anf functionality.
</p>

<h4 id="Sources">Sources of Requirements</h4>
<h5>Industry Standard Best Practices</h5>
  <p>Industry standard best practices contain guidance for configuring systems for both optimal performance as well as the best security configuration.  This guidance is intendd to be used as guidance as opposed to requirements.  They are used to provide a basis for the creation and  implementation of operational and security policy.
</p>
<h5>Centers for Internet Security</h5>
<p>The Center for Internet Security (CIS) is a 501(c) nonprofit organization formed in October, 2000. Its mission is to "identify, develop, validate, promote, and sustain best practice solutions for cyber defense and build and lead communities to enable an environment of trust in cyberspace".  The organization is headquartered in East Greenbush, New York, with members including large corporations, government agencies, and academic institutions.
CIS employs a closed crowdsourcing model to identify and refine effective security measures, with individuals developing recommendations that are shared with the community for evaluation through a consensus decision-making process. At the national and international level, CIS plays an important role in forming security policies and decisions by maintaining the CIS Controls and CIS Benchmarks, and hosting the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC).
</p>
<h5>Agency Specific Guidance</h5>
<p>Agencies, government or private, provide configuration-specific guiance on how systems shouild be configured to provide the most profociency  and seciurity.  This guidance can be implemented in examples which include but are not limited to:
STIG (Security Technical Implemntation Guidance),  STIG guidance contains suggestions on how systems should be configured.  This gudance covers many aspects of computing to include operating systems, databases, network configurations, email systems, DNS, web browsers, web servers,  application security, physical security, and others.
FISCAM (Federal Information Security Controls Aidit Manual) 
SCAP
</p>

<h5>Vendor Proprietary Guidance</h5>
<p>Vendors provide guidance on how their systems operate and provide exmples of how their systems should perform.</p>
<h5>Computer Security At of 1974</h5>
<p>The Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law No. 100-235 (H.R. 145), (Jan. 8, 1988), was a United States federal law enacted in 1987. It was intended to improve the security and privacy of sensitive information in federal computer systems and to establish minimally acceptable security practices for such systems. It required the creation of computer security plans, and appropriate training of system users or owners where the systems would display, process or store sensitive information.

</p>

<h5>Committe On Nastional Security Systems</h5>
<p>In 2005, a formalized policy was drafed to address specifi requirements for certification processes.  
The Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) Policy (CNSSP) No. 22 dated January 2012 cancelled CNSS Policy No. 6, “National Policy on Certification and Accreditation of National Security Systems,” dated October 2005, and National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Instruction (NSTISSI) 1000, “National Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (NIACAP),” dated April 2000. CNSSP No. 22 also states that "The CNSS intends to adopt National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) issuances where applicable. Additional CNSS issuances will occur only when the needs of NSS are not sufficiently addressed in a NIST document. Annex B identifies the guidance documents, which includes NIST Special Publications (SP), for establishing an organization-wide risk management program." It directs the organization to make use of NIST Special Publication 800-37, which implies that the Risk management framework (RMF) STEP 5 – AUTHORIZE INFORMATION SYSTEM replaces the Certification and Accreditation process for National Security Systems, just as it did for all other areas of the Federal government who fall under SP 800-37 Rev. 1.  </p>

<h5>Exeutice Orders</h5>
<p>Executive Orders are issued by the White House and are used to direct the Executive Branch of the U.S. Government. Executive Orders state mandatory requirements for the Executive Branch, and have the effect of law. They are issued in relation to a law passed by Congress or based on powers granted to the President in the Constitution and must be consistent with those authorities. Executive Orders are given numbers and abbreviated as “EO XXXXX”. Executive Orders are numbered in ascending order, so a higher number means the order was given more recently. Executive Orders may amend earlier orders.

<h4 id="Processes">Accreditation Processes</h4>

<h5>NIACAP</h5>
<p>The National Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (NIACAP). </p>
The National Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (NIACAP) formerly was the minimum-standard process for the certification and accreditation of computer and telecommunications systems that handle U.S. national-security information. NIACAP was derived from the Department of Defense Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP), and it played a key role in the National Information Assurance Partnership.</p>

</p>

<h5>DITSCAP</h5>
<p>THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITYCERTIFICATION AND ACCREDITATION PROCESS (DITSCAP On August 19, 1992 the Office of Assistant Secretary of Defense directed the DefenseInformation Systems Agency (DISA) Center for Information Systems Security (CISS) toformulate a standard DoD process for security certification and accreditation. CISS formed aworking group, consisting of Service and Agency representatives. The working groupevaluated ten existing processes, but found none which could be adopted Department ofDefense (DoD)-wide. As a result, the working group developed the DoD InformationTechnology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP) [1]. A standardprocess across DoD, DITSCAP applies to accreditation of both strategic and tactical systems,as well as stand-alone information systems or networks. DITSCAP capitalized on approvedsecurity techniques, software, and procedures to reduce the complexity and overall cost of theaccreditation process. The DITSCAP integrates security directly into the system life cycle andis designed so that it can be applied uniformly across DoD. The DITSCAP defines a processwhich standardizes all activities leading to a successful accreditation, thereby minimizing therisks associated with nonstandard security implementations across shared DefenseInformation Infrastructure (DII) and end systems. The DITSCAP has been designed to supportthe requirements of Office of Management and Budget Circular A-130 [2].In contrast to the prevailing system based accreditation processes, the DITSCAP is focused onthe infrastructure and views systems and networks as components of the infrastructure. Theview of the DITSCAP, therefore, differs from such documents as the National ComputerSecurity Center (NCSC) Certification and Accreditation Process Handbook for Certifiers(NCSC-TG-031) [3]. CISS and the NCSC have agreed that for the near term, NCSC-TG-031provides sound guidelines. DITSCAP provides the midterm and long term infrastructure-centricapproach to the security certification and accreditation of systems and networks. These twoprocesses have been harmonized to reflect the transition to the DITSCAP. Both terminologyand structural parallels will facilitate a smooth transition between these two processes.

<h5>DIACAP</h5>
<p>The DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) is the Department of Defense (DoD) process to ensure that risk management is applied on Information Systems (IS). DoDI lays down the foundation of definitions and controls for Information Assurance (IA) across DoD. DIACAP is the result of a NSA directed shift in underlying security paradigm and succeeds its predecessor: DITSCAP.</p>

<p>DIACAP embraces of the idea of information assurance controls (defined in DoDI 8500.2) as the primary set of security requirements for all automated information systems (AISs). The IA Controls are determined based on the system’s mission assurance category (MAC) and confidentiality level (CL).</p>

<p>The DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) is a deprecated United States Department of Defense (DoD) process meant to ensure companies and organizations applied risk management to information systems (IS). DIACAP defined a DoD-wide formal and standard set of activities, general tasks and a management structure process for the certification and accreditation (C&A) of a DoD IS which maintained the information assurance (IA) posture throughout the system's life cycle. </p>
<p>(Text taken from https://www.netsurion.com/regulatory-compliance/dodi-8500) </p>

<p>As of May 2015, the DIACAP was replaced by the "Risk Management Framework (RMF) for DoD Information Technology (IT)". Although re-accreditations via DIACAP continued through late 2016, systems that had not yet started accreditation by May 2015 were required to transition to the RMF processes.[1] The DoD RMF aligns with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Risk Management Framework (RMF) (Text taken from </p><p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defense_Information_Assurance_Certification_and_Accreditation_Process)</p>

<h5>Risk Management Framework (RMF)</h5>
<p>The Risk Management Framework is a United States federal government policy and standards to help secure information systems (computers and networks) developed by National Institute of Standards and Technology. </p>
<p>The two main publications that cover the details of RMF are NIST Special Publication 800-37, "Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems", and NIST Special Publication 800-53, "Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations".</p>
<p>NIST Special Publication 800-37, "Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems", developed by the Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative Working Group, transforms the traditional Certification and Accreditation (C&A) process into the Risk Management Framework (RMF).</p>
<p>The Risk Management Framework (RMF), illustrated at right, provides a disciplined and structured process that integrates information security and risk management activities into the system development life cycle.[1]</p>

<p>The RMF steps include:</p>

   <p> Categorize the information system and the information processed, stored, and transmitted by that system based on an impact analysis. Vested party is identified.</p>
    <p>Select an initial set of baseline security controls for the information system based on the security categorization; tailoring and supplementing the security control baseline as needed based on an organizational assessment of risk and local conditions. If any overlays apply to the system it will be added in this step</p>
   <p> Implement the security controls identified in step 2.</p>
  <p>  Assess: a third party assesses the controls and verifies that the controls are properly applied to the system.</p>
   <p> Authorize: the information system is granted or denied an Authorization to Operate (ATO), in some cases it may be postponed while certain items are fixed. The ATO is based on the report from the Assessment phase.</p>
   <p> Monitor: the security controls in the information system are monitored in a pre-planned fashion documented earlier in the process. ATO is good for 3 years, every 3 years the process needs to be repeated.</p>

<h4 id="accredit">Accreditation</h4>
  <p>Acreditation is the formalized approval of a system for usage of official data.  This approval is provided by the owner(s) of the data to be processedby the system.  Accreditation is usually granted after a system has been evaluated and certified. through a certification process.
</p>

<h4 id="Process">Accreditation Process Phases</h4>
  <p>The Four Phases of the Certification and Accreditation Process</p>
<p>Achieving compliance and accreditation for public sector data center deployments can be a difficult undertaking, as it requires a strict adherence to federally-mandated laws and guidelines. Federal agency CIO’s are tasked with establishing an agency-wide compliance program from the top down to certify that all information systems under agency control are federally compliant. QTS has a dedicated Public Sector team to handle the special challenges and concerns for this audience. Learn more about our focus on the public sector. </p>
<p>How does a government agency validate if a federal information system is compliant, and how does the agency maintain compliance throughout the life cycle of the system? The National Institute of Standards and Technology has developed a four-phase C&A process used by the federal government to certify compliance with mandated federal controls.</p>


<p>Each phase has a list of C&A activities that must be completed before beginning the next phase.</p>
<h5>Phase I: Initiation and Planning</h5>
<p>The ?rst phase of the C&A process is initiation and planning. In this phase, the information system owner and the designated Information System Security Of?cer (ISSO) will formally initiate the C&A process by acknowledging that a C&A is required, establishing a C&A team, developing a project plan with milestones, determining a formal security classi?cation for the system and deciding what resources are required to perform a C&A process. In most cases, for commercially-hosted federal systems, the system owner will outsource the C&A process to the systems integrator or Managed Service Provider (MSP). This is important because the C&A process is a large undertaking and requires substantial resources, including experienced and knowledgeable InfoSec and compliance professionals to complete the C&A package properly. Attempting to tackle the C&A process without the proper knowledge or resources can lead to costly delays and potentially a denial of accreditation.</p>
<p>The C&A package preparer will be responsible for compiling all of the required C&A package documentation, such as the System Security Plan (SSP), and performing a risk assessment. Based on the outcome of the risk assessment, any risk that cannot be remediated will be added to the Plan of Actions and Milestones (POAM) for review by the Certifying Authority (CA). The preliminary C&A package must be completed and reviewed by the CA before moving onto phase two – Certi?cation.</p>
<h5>Phase II: Certi?cation</h5>
<p>In the Certi?cation phase, a team of independent auditors will perform a review of the preliminary C&A package and audit the information system utilizing a checklist to certify that the proper controls – based on NIST special publication 800.53 – have been implemented. The independent audit will consist of onsite interviews, vulnerability scans, and visual inspections and testing. Once the independent audit is complete, the auditors will assemble a formal C&A package with the results of their evaluation and make a recommendation to the CA on the certi?cation worthiness of the system.</p>
<h5>Phase III: Accreditation</h5>
<p>In the Accreditation phase, the Certifying Authority will review the completed C&A package to validate that all of the required information is contained within the package before making an accreditation decision. Once the Certifying Authority has reviewed the final C&A package and auditor’s recommendations, he/she will make a determination to accept any non-remediated risk before granting an accreditation. If the CA concludes that the C&A package contains all of the required documentation and there are no unacceptable risks, a formal letter of accreditation will be issued to the system owner, granting the system owner the Authority to Operate (ATO). ATO’s are valid for three years and must be renewed at the end of the three-year cycle in order for the federal system to continue to operate. Failure to renew a system ATO may result in a denial of authority to operation.</p>
<h5>Phase IV: Continuous Monitoring</h5>
<p>In order to maintain the system’s compliant baseline and to detect any new threats to the system, a process of continuous monitoring must be implemented. ISSO’s utilize intrusion detection tools, sys logs and change management procedures to monitor and prevent any unauthorized changes to the compliance baseline. By establishing a process to continuously monitor the information system, the ISSO can detect any con?guration changes or compromises that may adversely impact the system. In addition to ISSO continuous monitoring, Federal Agencies may perform onsite annual audits to ensure the information system has maintained its compliance baseline.</p>
